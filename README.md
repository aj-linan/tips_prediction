# Tips prediction and API deployment

The aim of this file is to develop a simple model. Serialise it and save it. To finally deploy the application with Heroku.

We have used data about the tips of a restaurant that opens from Thursday to Sunday to give lunches and dinners. With this data, we are going to try to predict the tips left by each table.

It is a proof of concept, the main idea is to develop and deploy an application. The model is therefore very simple.
